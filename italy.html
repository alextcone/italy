		<h1>Alex's Italian Eating Recs</h1>
		<p>What follows is a listing of all the restaurants Alex thinks you should frequent if you are making a trip to Italy, specifically Firenze and Roma. While this is not an exhaustive list, if you chose to follow it you can rest assured that when you leave Italy you will have tasted some of the best food it has to offer.</p>

	<h2>FIRENZE</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/u8Lxw" target="_blank">La Casalinga</a><br>Via de' Michelozzi, 9</li>
		<p>Across the street from my home for a year, Casalinga is an institution. At lunch you'll see both florentine construction workers and tourists. This is a great sign because it means the food is so good that the old guard still eats there despite its popularity in travel guides.</p>
		<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/SZvzu" target="_blank">Trattoria Anita</a><br>Via del Parlascio, 2</li>
		<p>Eat here for lunch. For 9&euro; you get a first course, second course and a side dish. Go ahead an get a litro di vino rosso della casa. I do not know of a better meal at this price point. Anywhere in the world.</p>
		<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/ffGJN" target="_blank">I Raddi</a><br>Via d'Ardiglione, 47</li>
		<p>One of a few great places to go for Bistecca alla Fiorentina. They've also got great antipasti as I recall. Antipasti are a great way to go if you are getting la bistecca because you won't want fill up on pasta if you're ordering multiple kilos of beef.</p>
		<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/qePPF" target="_blank">O'Munaciello</a><br>Via Maffia, 31</li>
		<p>If you can't go to Napoli, this is the next best thing. The pizza here is authentic Napolitano and the decor is rad to boot. In addition to pizzas for everyone be sure to order the burrata. It's ridiculous, so make a reservation.</p>
		<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/9stWt" target="_blank">Trattoria La Sostanza (or lovingly, "La Troia")</a><br>Via della Porcellana, 25</li>
		<p>In English, the colloquial term for this wonderland is "the whore." Order trippa. Order bistecca. Order what Robbie Shackelford calls "the buttered chicken." In fact, order everything on the menu because this is as florentine as it gets. Make a reservation because it gets packed.</p>
		<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/wwesn" target="_blank">Enoteca Fuori Porta</a><br>Via del Monte alle Croci, 4</li>
		<p>Crazy wine list. Well off the beaten path. Go here for lots of glasses of red and antipasti.</p>
		<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/rY1Dl" target="_blank">Hemingway</a><br>Piazza Piattellina, 9</li>
		<p>If it's cold, go in the afternoon for hot chocolate. This place is super snug in an even snuggly-er neighborhood. If you haven't already noticed, most of these recommendations are "Oltrarno" meaning on the south side of the Arno. This is certainly an area where you are most likely to stumble upon a gem without any prior research.</p>
	</ul>

	<h2>ROMA</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/MqdVi" target="_blank">Trattoria der Pallaro</a><br>Largo del Pallaro, 15</li>
		<p>Here you will sit down, be asked "rosso" or "bianco" (wine preference) and then proceed to be plied with traditional Roman home cooking. When I say home cooking I mean it. The old lady that runs the kitchen will come out to greet you here and there throughout the meal.</p>
		<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2PTUR" target="_blank">Pizzeria La Montecarlo</a><br>Vicolo Savelli, 13</li>
		<p>Maybe the best pizza I've ever eaten. I prefer the prociutto crudo pizza, but I don't know that there's a bad choice on the menu as far as pizza goes. They also do a good, generous helping of pasta all'amatriciana or pasta alla carbonara, Roman specialties. The wait staff are all characters.</p>
		<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/BDa0u" target="_blank">Ristorante Archimede S. Eustachio</a><br>Piazza dei Caprettari, 63</li>
		<p>The fanciest restaurant on this list. Typically, I'm not a fan of the fancy restaurant in Italy, but I make exception here. I've had some of the most memorable meals of my life at this establishment.</p>
